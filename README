How to Generate Random Text:

1. You need to pass a directory of txt files or a single txt file to the preprocessor.  The preprocessor will produce a file named ```processed``` in your local directory.
First enter the root directory (i.e. src), then run ```javac preprocessor/*.java```.  To run simply run ```java preprocessor.Preprocessor <directory or txt file>```;
This will output a file called "processed"

2. Next you must run the NGram builder. You must pass the processed file path to "processed" and the size of ngram you want. This will produce a "grams" file.

First enter the root directory (i.e. src), then run ```javac *.java```.  Then to run the program run ```java BuildNgramModel <path to processed file> <length of n gram>```

3. Finally, to produce text you run the language processor.  The language processor will take the processed file "grams" and the number of sentences you want.

First enter the root directory (i.e. src), then run ```javac *.java```.  Then to run the program run ```java LanguageGenerator <path to grams file> <number of sentences>```
